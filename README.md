Create a mock twitter page that pulls from online weather server. 

Used bootstrap for display formatting (navbar), and jquery to show page when loaded.
We created an onclick function for pause, that gives an alert to tell the user what happened and how to unpause.
Using the server URL we used fetch within an asynchronous function (set interval) to fetch data every 5 seconds.
Then we put the necessary json elements into their respective display spans and divs.
